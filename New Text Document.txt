 1.Write a blog on Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2

  HTTP1:

   1. Developed by Timothy Berners-Lee in 1989 as a communication standard for the World Wide Web.
   2.it uses text command request cycle.
   3.it loads resource one after the other, so if one source cannot be loaded,it blocks all the other resource behind it.
   4.A server ony serves content to a client device only if the client ask for it.
   5.It loads a single request for every TCP connection.


  HTTP2:

   1.HTTP2 is more worthy and trustable than HTTP1 request response cycle.
   2.Can snt multiple request for data in parallel for data in parallel over single TCP connection.
   3.eficient and robust in terms of processing of data between client and server.

  2.Write a blog about objects and its internal representation in Javascript

   1. objects are more complex and they contain any combination of primitive data type and reference data type.
   2.object may contain numbers,strings, array etc. 
   3. for example :- let student ={
                                   name ='kavi kumar', 
                                   age= 23,
                                   id no = 9715
                                   }
